      "\n",
      "2. In step 2, consider adding additional error handling for extracting information from the scraped papers. For example, if a paper does not have an abstract, the code will raise an AttributeError. You can use a try-except block to handle such cases and continue with the next paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In step 3, it would be helpful to provide some guidance or examples for the scientist to implement their own logic for categorizing the papers. This will ensure that the categorization is done accurately and according to the desired criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. In step 5, it would be good to include a check to ensure that the markdown file is successfully saved. You can use the `file.write()` method's return value to check if the write operation was successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Lastly, it would be beneficial to include comments in the code to explain the purpose and functionality of each section. This will make it easier for others to understand and modify the code if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than these suggestions, the plan and code seem well-structured and should be able to accomplish the task of finding papers on LLM applications from arXiv and creating a markdown table of different domains.\n",
